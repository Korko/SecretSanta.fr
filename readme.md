SecretSanta is an organisation tool for your Secret Santa parties.
I wanted a tool to help me organise and get rid of all the problems of drawing from a hat. Sadly, nothing on the web satisfied me. They were too much complicated or simply required registration.
That's why I created this tool. Totally free, no registration and totally open source.
